# 09 — Project Brain

**Status:** Draft, carried into v0.2 scoping **Last Updated:** 2026-04-29 **Author:** Mitchell

Note: portions of this draft still describe the pre-MCP Obsidian Local REST design. The implemented runtime has since moved to an MCP-backed vault backend; treat REST-specific details here as historical planning context, not the current supported path.

Current phase note: v0.1 shipped the brain as reactive tools only. The v0.2 runtime now includes proactive brain retrieval in context assembly, a dedicated brain budget tier, context-report visibility, explicit `yard brain index`, relational brain metadata, a semantic LanceDB brain index, and hybrid keyword/semantic/graph search when the runtime searcher is available. The maintained live proofs cover fact canaries, rationale/decision notes, convention/policy notes, and prior-debugging/history notes.

---

## Overview

The project brain is a persistent, project-scoped knowledge base backed by an Obsidian vault. It accumulates intelligence over the lifetime of working on a codebase — architectural decisions, debugging insights, conventions, session histories, relationship maps, and anything else worth persisting across sessions.

Both the developer and the agent are co-authors. The developer works directly in Obsidian — reading, editing, organizing, browsing the graph view. The agent reads from and writes to the vault via tools, and context assembly queries the brain alongside code RAG to surface relevant project knowledge on each turn.

This is sodoryard's long-term memory. Conversations are ephemeral — they live for a session, get compressed, eventually fade. The brain is where durable insights get extracted and persisted. A conversation is a working session. The brain is the institutional knowledge that sessions contribute to.

---

## Why Obsidian

Obsidian is not just a markdown renderer. It's a structured knowledge tool with primitives that a plain directory of files can't replicate.

**Wikilinks (`[[double brackets]]`).** Bidirectional linking between documents. If "auth-architecture.md" links to `[[provider-design]]`, Obsidian tracks that relationship in both directions. This is a graph — not a pile of files. When the agent writes `[[context-assembly-decisions]]` in a debugging note, that's a semantic connection that retrieval can exploit. "Find everything linked to context assembly" becomes a graph traversal, not a keyword search.

**Tags.** `#architecture`, `#debugging`, `#convention`, `#tech-debt`. Lightweight categorization that the agent applies when writing and that retrieval filters on.

**Frontmatter (YAML).** Structured metadata — created date, author, status, related topics. The agent writes this, the retrieval layer queries on it, Obsidian renders it cleanly.

**Graph view.** Obsidian's built-in graph visualization shows how documents connect — clusters of related knowledge, orphaned documents, interconnection density. We don't build this; Obsidian gives it for free.

**Canvas.** Spatial layouts of cards, notes, and connections. Architectural diagrams, flow maps, decision trees — all inside the vault. Future territory, but available.

**Plugin ecosystem.** Dataview for structured queries across documents. Templater for document templates. Git integration for version-controlled vaults. Available when needed.

**Local-first, file-based.** Obsidian vaults are directories of markdown files on disk. No proprietary format, no server dependency, no sync requirement. Architecturally aligned with sodoryard.

---

## Architecture

The brain is not a feature bolted onto sodoryard. It's a first-class component with its own storage, retrieval logic, tools, and lifecycle.

### Integration Model

Historical-design note: the diagram below still contains older REST boxes to preserve planning context, but the live runtime path today is MCP/vault-backed tool access plus derived SQLite/LanceDB brain indexes rebuilt by `yard brain index`.

Obsidian runs alongside sodoryard as the human-facing vault UI, but the implemented runtime path is now the in-process MCP-backed vault backend. sodoryard talks to the vault through `internal/brain/mcpclient` and MCP `vault_*` tools rather than the older Obsidian Local REST API design.

### What Lives Where

**In Obsidian (source of truth):** All brain documents. Markdown files with frontmatter, wikilinks, tags. The developer reads, edits, organizes, and browses here. Obsidian's graph view visualizes the knowledge structure.

**In sodoryard today (tools + proactive retrieval):** The agent-facing interface and the current proactive retrieval source of truth. Read/write/search operations go through the MCP/vault backend. Proactive context assembly currently uses keyword search from that same backend.

**In future brain-index work (not yet the active runtime path):** Vector embeddings of brain documents in a separate LanceDB collection. A parsed wikilink graph stored in SQLite. Extracted frontmatter metadata and tags for structured queries. If this becomes real operator-facing behavior, it should be described as a derived layer under the MCP/vault source of truth rather than implied as already-landed runtime.

**In sodoryard current v0.2 runtime (context assembly):** Brain keyword retrieval runs in parallel with code RAG during context assembly. Results compete for budget alongside code chunks, are serialized into a distinct Project Brain section, and appear in context reports/inspector payloads.

## Vault Structure

The vault is an Obsidian vault at a configurable path. The directory structure is freeform — the agent and developer organize however makes sense. Flat, nested, by date, by topic. The retrieval layer searches content regardless of file location.

### Document Format

Brain documents are Obsidian-native markdown. The agent writes documents that work naturally in Obsidian:

# LanceDB CGo Nil Slice Segfault

## Problem

Passing a nil Go slice to the LanceDB CGo bindings causes a segfault
in the C layer. This manifests as a SIGSEGV with no Go stack trace —
the crash is below the CGo boundary.

## Root Cause

The C layer dereferences the slice pointer without nil checking.
The Go slice header has a nil data pointer when the slice is nil,
and the C code assumes it's always valid.

## Workaround

Always pre-allocate slices before passing to LanceDB:

```go
// BAD — nil slice causes segfault
var embeddings []float32
store.Insert(embeddings)

// GOOD — empty but non-nil slice
embeddings := make([]float32, 0, expectedSize)
store.Insert(embeddings)
`` `

## Impact

Affects any code path that might pass an empty result set to
LanceDB — particularly the indexer when processing files with
no extractable symbols.

## Related

- [[tech-stack-decisions]] — why we accepted CGo as a dependency
- [[rag-pipeline-audit]] — the LanceDB evaluation that first surfaced this
- [[error-handling]] — our convention for handling CGo boundary errors
```

---

## What Goes In the Brain

The brain accumulates any project knowledge worth persisting across sessions:

**Architectural decisions and rationale.** Why we chose Go, why CGo is accepted, how the provider architecture works. The *why* behind choices — exactly what's lost when conversations end.

**Debugging journals.** Hard-won operational knowledge. "The tree-sitter Go parser doesn't handle generics well. Workaround: fall back to Go AST parser for files with type parameters." These are the war stories that save hours of rediscovery.

**Conventions not derivable from code.** "We don't use go-git because of index desync issues — always shell out to git." The convention extractor in [[04-code-intelligence-and-rag]] derives patterns from code analysis. The brain stores conventions that require judgment — anti-patterns, rationale, exceptions to rules.

**Implementation notes.** Specific technical details too granular for architecture docs but too important to lose. "The Anthropic OAuth token refresh writes back to ~/.claude/.credentials.json. Use advisory file locking to avoid races with Claude Code."

**Session summaries.** Breadcrumb trail of what's been done. "2026-03-28: Designed context assembly system. Key decisions: always-on RAG, rule-based turn analyzer, 3 cache breakpoints, 30k token budget cap."

**Relationship maps.** Architectural knowledge that's implicit in the code but takes significant reading to reconstruct. "The payment flow goes: handler → service → gateway → Stripe API. The gateway package owns all external HTTP calls."

**Known issues and tech debt.** "The description generator sometimes produces vague descriptions for small utility functions. Impact: reduced retrieval quality for helper functions. Future fix: use a better local model or add few-shot examples."

There is no size limit on the vault. No document count limit. No enforced structure. The brain grows as large as it needs to. The retrieval layer handles finding what's relevant; the developer and agent handle curation.

---

## Retrieval

The current runtime has two coordinated brain retrieval paths:

- **MCP/vault-backed lexical search:** `brain_search` keyword mode and context assembly can query the vault source of truth directly.
- **Derived hybrid search:** when the runtime has a brain searcher, semantic and auto modes merge keyword hits, LanceDB semantic chunks, and optional graph/backlink hops from derived brain metadata.

`_log.md` operational notes are excluded from proactive context and tool search results so they do not compete with durable knowledge notes. `brain_search` also supports post-hoc tag filtering. The turn analyzer can emit brain-oriented signals such as `brain_intent` and `brain_seeking_intent`, plus stopword-stripped fallback keyword queries for weak long-form prompts.

### Search Modes

- `keyword`: deterministic lexical search through the configured MCP/vault backend. This is the tool default when `mode` is omitted.
- `semantic`: runtime search over the derived brain semantic index when available. If a runtime searcher is unavailable, the tool reports that limitation and falls back to keyword search.
- `auto`: hybrid runtime search that can combine keyword, semantic, and derived graph/backlink signals.

Context assembly may use its own hybrid retrieval path even though the explicit `brain_search` tool defaults to `keyword`.

---

## Indexing

Brain notes remain source-of-truth files in the configured vault (`.brain/` by default). `yard brain index` rebuilds derived metadata from that vault:

- scans vault documents and computes content hashes
- parses frontmatter, titles, tags, and wikilinks
- rebuilds relational metadata in SQLite (`brain_documents`, `brain_links`)
- chunks note content, embeds chunks, and writes semantic vectors to `.yard/lancedb/brain`
- deletes semantic chunks for notes that were removed
- marks the brain index state fresh on success

Agent mutations through `brain_write` and `brain_update` mark the derived brain index stale with reason `brain_write` or `brain_update`. Operators refresh derived metadata and semantic chunks by running `yard brain index` again. Developer edits outside the agent path likewise require an explicit index run before semantic/graph retrieval should be assumed fresh.

The web/API project metadata exposes brain index state as `brain_index.status`, `last_indexed_at`, `stale_since`, and `stale_reason`. Expected statuses are `never_indexed`, `fresh`, and `stale`.

### Chunking Strategy

Brain documents are split at `##` heading boundaries (same as the markdown fallback parser in the code indexer). Each section becomes a separate vector. This means a long architecture document with 8 sections produces 8 embeddings, each retrievable independently. The section heading provides context for what the chunk is about.

Short documents (under ~1000 characters) are embedded as a single chunk.

### Index Storage

- **Vector embeddings:** Separate LanceDB collection (`brain_chunks`), same LanceDB instance as code. Schema includes: document_id, chunk_index, chunk_text, embedding, document_path, document_title, tags (JSON), created_at, updated_at.
- **Wikilink graph:** SQLite table `brain_links` with columns: source_path, target_path, link_text. Enables bidirectional traversal.
- **Document metadata:** SQLite table `brain_documents` with columns: path, title, content_hash, tags (JSON), frontmatter (JSON), created_at, updated_at, created_by, source_session_id, token_count.

These tables live in the main sodoryard SQLite database alongside conversation and metrics tables.

## Tools

Five tools for the agent. All project-scoped — they operate on the current project's brain vault via the MCP/vault backend and, where noted, the derived brain index.

### brain_search

Search the brain by query. Returns document titles, paths, relevant snippets, match source information when available, tags, and derived relationship context.

**Purity:** Pure when query logging is disabled; mutating when `brain.log_brain_queries` appends an operation note.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required): The search query
- `mode` (string, optional): `keyword`, `semantic`, or `auto`; default is `keyword`
- `tags` ([]string, optional): Filter by tags
- `max_results` (int, optional): Maximum results to return (default 10)

**Returns:** Ranked list of matches with: document path, title, relevant snippet, match score/source when available, tags, linked documents.

### brain_read

Read a specific brain document by path. Returns the full markdown content.

**Purity:** Pure (read-only)

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required): Path relative to vault root
- `include_backlinks` (bool, optional): If true, also return a list of documents that link to this one (default false)

**Returns:** Document content, frontmatter metadata, outgoing wikilinks, and optionally backlinks.

### brain_write

Create a new document or overwrite an existing one. The agent writes Obsidian-native markdown — frontmatter, wikilinks, tags.

**Purity:** Mutating

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required): Path relative to vault root (creates parent directories if needed)
- `content` (string, required): Full markdown content including frontmatter

**Behavior:**
- Creates or overwrites the file through the MCP/vault backend
- Marks the derived brain index stale after successful mutation
- Returns confirmation with the document path

### brain_update

Append to or edit a section of an existing document. More surgical than full overwrite — the agent can add a section to a debugging journal or update a specific heading without rewriting the entire file.

**Purity:** Mutating

**Parameters:**
- `path` (string, required): Path relative to vault root
- `operation` (string, required): "append", "prepend", or "replace_section"
- `content` (string, required): Content to add or replace with
- `section` (string, optional): Heading text to target for `replace_section` (e.g., "## Workaround")

**Behavior:**
- Reads the current document, applies the operation, and writes back through the MCP/vault backend
- Marks the derived brain index stale after successful mutation
- Returns the updated document content

### brain_lint

Lint the brain for structural and curation issues.

**Purity:** Mutating when operation logging is enabled; otherwise read-only in effect.

**Parameters:**
- `scope` (string, optional): Scope to inspect; defaults to `full`
- `checks` ([]string, optional): Subset of checks: `orphans`, `dead_links`, `stale_references`, `missing_pages`, `contradictions`, `tag_hygiene`
- `allow_model_calls` (bool, optional): Required for `contradictions`

**Behavior:**
- Loads the scoped documents through the MCP/vault backend
- Runs deterministic hygiene checks locally
- Runs contradiction checks only when explicitly allowed because they can call the configured provider
- Returns a markdown lint report suitable for receipts or operator review

## v0.2 Integration with Context Assembly

This section is no longer just distant future direction. In v0.1, the brain was reactive-only and accessed through Layer 4 brain tools. In current v0.2 runtime, context assembly performs proactive brain retrieval and reports those results through the inspector/context-report path.

The current runtime answer is: proactive brain retrieval starts from the MCP/vault backend and can be enriched by the derived semantic/graph index after `yard brain index`. Operational brain log notes like `_log.md` are excluded from proactive context so they do not compete with real knowledge notes.

### How Brain Queries Are Derived

Current implementation reuses the deterministic query-extraction path and then applies a small amount of brain-specific routing during retrieval. That is enough to support the first live proof, but it is not yet a fully brain-aware analyzer/query pipeline.

Today the flow is roughly:

- User says "fix the auth middleware" → existing cleaned/technical queries can also drive brain keyword search for "auth middleware"
- User says "what is the runtime brain proof canary phrase" → analyzer emits a `brain_intent` signal, retrieval can prefer brain context over generic code RAG for that turn, and literal keyword search falls back to a stopword-stripped candidate such as "runtime brain proof canary"
- User says "walk me through the rationale behind our minimal content-first layout decision" → analyzer emits a `brain_seeking_intent` signal (`value: "rationale"`) on a narrow rationale/decision phrase set (`rationale behind`, `rationale for`, `design decision`, `design choice`, `design rationale`, `why did we`, `why are we`). Retrieval prefers brain context the same way as explicit brain prompts, and brain keyword candidates now include a longest-content-word fallback ("rationale") so long prose queries still reach the matching note when the full stopword-stripped phrase cannot substring-match the note body.
- User says "what's our convention for naming new pattern lists?" → analyzer emits a `brain_seeking_intent` signal (`value: "convention"`) on a narrow convention/policy phrase set (`how do we usually`, `how do we normally`, `what do we prefer`, `what's our convention`, `what is our convention`, `our convention for`, `our convention is`, `our policy for`, `our policy is`, `what's our policy`, `what is our policy`). Bare `how do we` is deliberately excluded because it collides with generic code-explanation noise.
- User says "have we seen a vite rebuild loop before? what was the fix?" → analyzer emits a `brain_seeking_intent` signal (`value: "history"`) on a narrow prior-debugging/history phrase set (`have we seen`, `have we hit`, `have we debugged`, `have we fixed`, `what was the fix`, `what was the workaround`, `what was the root cause`, `did we ever fix`, `did we already fix`, `prior debugging`, `past debugging`, `previously debugged`). Bare `did we` and bare `what was` are deliberately excluded because they collide with the rationale family, arbitrary past-tense questions, and debug prompts like `what was null here`. Only the first brain-seeking family to match a turn emits a signal, so a prompt that combines rationale + convention + history phrases still emits exactly one `brain_seeking_intent` — the precedence order is: explicit `brain_intent` → `rationale` → `convention` → `history`.

So the current operator truth is:
- the existing signal/query path makes proactive brain retrieval work for explicit brain prompts and all three non-explicit families (rationale/decision, convention/policy, prior-debugging/history)
- semantic and graph enrichment are derived-index features; they require a fresh `yard brain index` and a runtime searcher
- richer tag-aware query expansion remains future work unless explicitly landed later

### Budget Fitting Priority

This is now the implemented runtime direction: brain results compete with code chunks for budget, and brain documents sit between explicit files and top RAG code hits:

1. **Explicit files** (user mentioned them directly)
2. **Brain documents** (project knowledge — architecture, debugging, conventions)
3. **Top RAG code hits** (above threshold, de-duped, re-ranked)
4. **Structural graph results** (callers/callees of identified symbols)
5. **Conventions** (derived from code analysis)
6. **Git context** (recent commits)
7. **Lower-ranked RAG code hits** (fill remaining budget)

Rationale: brain documents contain high-level knowledge — architectural context, decision rationale, debugging insights. This is often more valuable than the fifth-ranked code function in the results. When the agent knows *why* the auth system is designed the way it is, it makes better decisions about *how* to modify it.

This ranking is a starting point for v0.2. The context inspector will reveal whether brain documents are genuinely helpful or displacing more valuable code context.

### Brain Budget Allocation

In v0.2, brain results get a configurable token budget within the overall MAX_CONTEXT_BUDGET:

```yaml
brain:
  max_brain_tokens: 8000              # Max tokens for brain content in assembled context
  brain_relevance_threshold: 0.30     # Separate threshold for brain semantic results
```

The brain budget is a soft cap within the overall budget — if brain results are highly relevant and code results are sparse, brain content can use more. If code results are dense and brain results are marginal, brain content uses less. The budget manager balances this dynamically.

### Serialization Format

In the current v0.2 runtime, brain results in the assembled context are serialized separately from code chunks:

```markdown
## Project Knowledge

### auth-architecture.md
Architecture decision: The auth system uses JWT tokens validated by middleware.
Token refresh is handled by the AuthService, not the middleware. The middleware
only validates — it never issues or refreshes tokens. This separation exists
because the refresh flow requires database access that the middleware layer
shouldn't have.

Related: [[provider-design]], [[error-handling]]

### tree-sitter-generics-workaround.md
The tree-sitter Go parser doesn't handle generics (type parameters) correctly.
When a Go file contains generic types, fall back to the Go AST parser instead.
This is detected by checking for `[` in type declarations during the parsing phase.

## Relevant Code

### internal/auth/middleware.go (lines 15-48)
...
```

In the current runtime, brain content is serialized before code chunks in the assembled context. This positions project knowledge early in the context where attention is highest.

---

## Agent Writing to the Brain

The agent writes to the brain when it discovers durable knowledge. This is a deliberate act, not an automatic dump.

### System Prompt Guidance

The base system prompt includes guidance for when to create or update brain documents:

```
You have access to a project brain — an Obsidian vault of persistent project
knowledge. Use brain_write and brain_update to capture durable insights:

- After resolving a non-obvious bug, write a debugging journal entry
- When an architectural decision is made during conversation, document it
- When you discover a convention or anti-pattern, record it
- At the end of a substantial work session, write a session summary

Write in Obsidian-native markdown: use YAML frontmatter, [[wikilinks]] to
related documents, and #tags for categorization. Link to existing brain
documents when relevant.

Do not write brain documents for trivial interactions. The brain is for
knowledge worth preserving across sessions.
```

### Writing Triggers

**Agent-initiated:** The agent judges that something is worth persisting. A complex debugging session that uncovers a subtle issue. An architectural decision made during conversation. A convention discovered while reading code. The agent uses judgment — not every session produces a brain document.

**Developer-initiated:** The developer explicitly asks: "write that up in the brain", "add that to the debugging notes", "create a session summary." Direct, intentional knowledge capture.

**Not auto-generated.** The agent does not automatically summarize every session into a brain document. That would flood the brain with low-signal entries. Automatic session summaries are a future consideration (v0.3), gated on quality — only sessions where meaningful work was done.

### Curation

Both the developer and agent can edit and delete brain documents. The developer curates in Obsidian — reorganizing, merging related notes, deleting stale entries. The agent can update existing documents via `brain_update` — adding new information to a debugging journal, updating a decision record with new context.

The brain has no artificial constraints on size, structure, or organization. It grows organically. The retrieval layer handles finding what's relevant; the humans and agent handle keeping it useful.

---

## Brain Configuration

Current runtime uses the project brain vault plus the MCP/vault backend. The minimal operator-facing setup is:

```yaml
brain:
  enabled: true
  vault_path: .brain
  log_brain_queries: true
  include_graph_hops: true
  graph_hop_depth: 1
```

Notes:
- `vault_path` is the source of truth for the brain content the tools and proactive retrieval operate on
- `log_brain_queries` gates both reactive `brain_search` trace logging and proactive brain-query debug logging
- `include_graph_hops` and `graph_hop_depth` control derived link/backlink expansion when a runtime searcher is available
- older REST-specific fields in historical drafts (`obsidian_api_url`, `obsidian_api_key`) should be treated as pre-MCP design baggage unless/until they are reintroduced intentionally
- semantic index storage is derived from `yard brain index` and lives under `.yard/lancedb/brain`

---

## Data Model

### SQLite Tables

```sql
-- Brain document metadata (derived from vault content)

    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- UUID

## Differences from Existing Components

**Brain vs. Code RAG ([[04-code-intelligence-and-rag]]):** Code RAG indexes source code — function bodies, type definitions, file structures. The brain stores knowledge *about* code — why things are the way they are, how systems relate, what to watch out for. Both code and brain now have semantic/vector-backed derived indexes, but the brain keeps the vault files as the source of truth and can always fall back to MCP/vault-backed keyword retrieval.

**Brain vs. Convention Extractor:** The convention extractor derives patterns mechanically from code analysis — "tests use `_test.go` suffix." The brain stores conventions that require judgment — "we don't use go-git because of index desync issues." They're complementary. The extractor tells you *what patterns exist*. The brain tells you *why certain patterns are followed* and *what patterns to avoid*.

**Brain vs. Conversation History:** Conversation history is ephemeral — it lives for a session, gets compressed, eventually summarized away. The brain is where the durable insights from conversations get extracted and persisted. After compression removes the details of a debugging session, the brain document about that bug survives intact.

**Brain vs. Hermes Memory:** Hermes uses MEMORY.md (~2200 chars) and USER.md (~1375 chars) — tiny, bounded, agent-curated scratchpads injected into every turn. The brain is unbounded, topic-organized, and retrieved contextually (not dumped wholesale). Hermes's approach is a notepad. The brain is a library.

## Dependencies

- [[06-context-assembly]] — Consumes brain results as a retrieval source; budget fitting allocates between brain and code context
- [[05-agent-loop]] — Four brain tools (`brain_read`, `brain_write`, `brain_update`, `brain_search`) in the tool registry
- [[04-code-intelligence-and-rag]] — Shared LanceDB instance (separate collection), shared embedding model (nomic-embed-code), shared embedding container
- [[08-data-model]] — `brain_documents` and `brain_links` tables in SQLite
- [[07-web-interface-and-streaming]] — "Open in Obsidian" links, brain results in context inspector
- MCP/vault brain backend — current runtime dependency for brain tools and proactive brain retrieval

---

## Future Directions

**Additional MCP productization (v0.5+):** The runtime already uses an MCP/vault backend internally. Future work here is about exposing that capability more broadly — for example surfacing brain tools as an MCP server for external tools, or standardizing richer backend contracts — rather than doing the original REST→MCP migration described in older drafts.

**MCP server exposure (v0.5+):** Expose sodoryard's brain tools as an MCP server, letting other tools (Claude Code, Codex) query the project brain. The brain becomes a shared knowledge layer across your entire tool chain.

**Obsidian URI integration (v0.3):** Use the `obsidian://` URI protocol to open specific documents from sodoryard's web UI. Click a brain reference in a conversation → Obsidian focuses that document.

**Session summary automation (v0.3):** At the end of sessions where meaningful work was done, the agent proposes a session summary for the brain. The developer approves, edits, or declines. Not fully automatic — gated on quality.

**Cross-project brain queries (v0.5+):** Search across multiple project brains. Patterns learned on project A that might apply to project B. Requires a brain registry that knows about all project vaults.

**Template system:** Obsidian Templater integration for standardized brain documents — decision records, debugging journals, session summaries. The agent uses templates when creating new documents for consistent structure.

## Build Phases

**v0.1 (foundation):** Brain tools were reactive-only. The agent could `brain_read`, `brain_write`, `brain_update`, and `brain_search`, but context assembly did not proactively include brain content.

**Current v0.2 state:** MCP/vault-backed proactive retrieval is live in context assembly. Derived relational metadata and semantic chunks are rebuilt by `yard brain index`; runtime search can merge keyword, semantic, and graph/backlink results. Brain hits have an explicit budget tier, serialize into a Project Brain section, persist in context reports, and have a dedicated ordered signal-flow endpoint at `/api/metrics/conversation/:id/context/:turn/signals`.

**Remaining v0.2 work:** Package a repeatable live validation recipe, keep query shaping/observability aligned with what the runtime actually does, and tune semantic-vs-keyword ranking quality.

**v0.3+ ideas:** Obsidian URI links from the web UI, session summary proposals, richer brain-aware quality metrics, cross-project queries, and templated brain documents remain future-facing design rather than committed runtime behavior.

## Open Questions

- **Embedding model for prose vs code:** Would a general-purpose embedding model outperform the current code-oriented defaults for prose-heavy notes?
- **Brain document size limits:** Very long brain documents (5000+ words) may need chunking beyond heading boundaries for effective embedding.
- **Conflict resolution:** If the agent writes a brain document while the developer has the same file open in Obsidian, what exact UX does the current vault workflow produce? Worth verifying directly.
- **Brain search latency in context assembly:** Hybrid retrieval should stay within the context-assembly latency budget.
